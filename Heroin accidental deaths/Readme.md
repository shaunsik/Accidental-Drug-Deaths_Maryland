I got inspired to do this SQL query to follow up on my previous findings of the top 3 immediate causes of death. 
When I realised that Heroin was a huge factor in causing deaths, I wanted to further findings by determing whether heroin was a major
presence in every case of death with this query. My findings were as follows:

# Heroin was present in around 60% of all cases of death in combination with other opiods.

This solidified my theory that heroin as a drug was by far the easiest to overdose on and the deadliest when combined with other drugs.
