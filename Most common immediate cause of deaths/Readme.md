I started this SQL query to determine what were the Top 20 most common immediate causes of death recorded in the data 
and here it is ranked:

1) Substance Abuse
2) Heroin intoxication/ heroin toxicity
3) Mutiple drug toxicity. 

These top 3 causes alone out of the top 20 accounted for 615 deaths out of 950+ total. Thats around 65%. This really highlights the danger
of Heroin specifically and using multiple drugs in conjunction. On top of that, the danger of substance abuse in the first place is also 
very clear.
