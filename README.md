# Accidental-Drug-Deaths_Connecticut

This is a project I started in order to showcase my SQL skills being used in data analysis. This project was done with a publicly available dataset that tallies accidental drug deaths in Connecticut. Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015. 

# My goals of this project were to figure out:
1) Which drugs were most deadly and most likely to cause overdose.
2) Which contributing factors contribute most to accidental deaths from drug overdoses (drug type, location, physiological reasons)
3) What was the most immediate cause death

# Table of contents:
1) SQL code to load the data into PGAdmin4
2) Accidental deaths caused by cocaine specifically
3) Total accidental deaths for females and males in 2016-2017
4) Top 20 most common immediate causes of deaths through drugs. 
5) Heroin accidental deaths ratio. (Follow up to findings in number 4)
6) Correlation between enviornment and tolerance
7) Cities in Conneticut with highest drug death rates accompanied by total drug counts of each drug for visualization. 

My findings on these numbers were pretty interesting. And we really went to show my how powerful SQL could be as a tool to filter
and extract data. I am pleased with my findings from this single dataset.
