# Accidental-Drug-Deaths_Connecticut

This is a project I started in order to showcase my SQL skills being used in data analysis. This project was done with a publicly available dataset that tallies accidental drug deaths in Connecticut. Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015. 

# My goals of this project were to figure out:
1) Which drugs were most deadly and most likely to cause overdose.
2) Which contributing factors contribute most to accidental deaths from drug overdoses (drug type, location, physiological reasons)
3) What was the most immediate cause death
