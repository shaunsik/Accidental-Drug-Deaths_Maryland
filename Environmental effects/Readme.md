In this SQL query I use UNION and UNION ALL to determine if enviornmental factors played a part in a cause of death.

This query was mostly inspired by multiple sources of research that show people who get alcohol poisoning tend to be drinking in a new
enviornment where their body wouldn't be prepared to heighten tolerance. 

These results didn't show the results I intended to because I didn't have other parameters to double check my findings. However,
it did show that around 25% of drug overdoses happen at cities away from their own residence. So this could be data to support 
the theory of lowered tolerance in different environments.
